In this task we were to research responsive web design and attempt to utilise it in a demonstrative way. 

The HTML file included here must meet the following criteria:

- Only have certain divs visible when viewed on different viewport sizes
- Use flexbox/grid to ensure that content is arranged differently depending on the viewport
